# semeval21-toxic-spans

## Introduction

There is an increasing trend of bullying via toxic comments on online discussion such as Reddit and Twitter which may lead to psychological effects on vulnerable victims. To combat this, SemEval-2021 Task 5: Toxic Spans Detection has been introduced. The task is to identify toxic spans from sentences in a document. Analysis has been done on the dataset to extract information. We have solved this task using pre-trained BERT, RoBERTa and Distil-BERT models, with adding the feature of data augmentation.

This project is for the project completion of ELEC4230 Deep Learning in Natural Language Processing in HKUST.
